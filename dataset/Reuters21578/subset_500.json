  "text": "BAKER SEEN WINNING GERMAN INTEREST RATES BATTLE The United States appears to have won a transatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interest rates, European economists said. But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were plunging. West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt, according to official statements released late Monday. Only 13 hours after the statements were released, the Bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pct facility rate offered last week. While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also added money market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want a strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday. \"It's round one to the Americans, \" said Richard Reid, senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in London. But Reid added, \"We shouldn't forget that it has taken one of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05 percentage point.\" Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tightening of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid. Six leading industrial nations agreed under February's Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary policies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven - the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada. The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading in New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday. Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at Deutsche Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West German short-term interest rates on Tuesday. \"The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market losses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits with Baker's wishes, then all the better,\" he said. No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises in the U.S., Aschoff said. Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern. Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London said \"The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat and Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as the security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was before the IMF meeting last month in Washington.\" Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord was reaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity at 3.60 pct, Keating noted. Economists said the United States now appeared to have agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates. Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder Washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenberg told a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not rule out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value. Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West Germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency stability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German central banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar.  ",

  "text": "ZAMBIA DOES NOT PLAN RETAIL MAIZE PRICE HIKE The Zambian government has no immediate plans to follow last week's increase in the producer price of maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an official of the ruling party said. Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in which at least 15 people died. That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill. However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67 dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies, a practice discouraged by the IMF. \"There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of meal.

USDA reduced the price of hard red winter wheat at Kansas City and Texas by six cents, at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents and at St Louis by nine cents, Ralph Klopfenstein, deputy administrator of commodity operations at the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, said. The department also lowered the terminal price of hard red spring wheat at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents, he said. In addition, USDA cut the Pacific Northwest price of hard red spring wheat by 31 cents, USDA officials who asked not to be identified said. The officials said hard red spring wheat prices at Chicago, Denver and Toledo were adjusted by about the same amount as at Pacific Northwest, Duluth and Minneapolis. The price changes should lead to a pickup of PIK and roll activity, Klopfenstein said. The price change was decided upon last week and will be effective today, he said. Klopfenstein also said the department raised the premiums on high protein wheat to offset the drop in low protein wheat prices, meaning the net price on any wheat commanding a protein premium would remain unchanged.

Earlier the companies said Squibb would buy from Cetus a five pct equity postion in Cetus for about 40 mln dlrs. \"This is not an attempt by Squibb to become a major majority holder in Cetus,\" Fildes told Reuters in an interview. \"Squibb has not approached us with any indication that they want to acquire us and we wouldn't be interested in that kind of arrangement,\" said Fildes. Squibb could not be reached to comment on the late comments by Fildes. Squibb is Cetus' first pharmaceutical partner and the only one to own an equity position in Cetus. Eastman Kodak Co &lt;EK> and W.R. Grace &lt;WR> both have joint ventures with Cetus, but neither owns an equity position in the company, said Fildes. Cetus has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnostic products and with Grace to develop agricultural products. Earlier, Squibb and Cetus announced in a joint statement an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to develop new biotechnology products in several fields.  As part of the deal Squibb will license several of Cetus' anticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development. Squibb will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets but not in North American and Western Europe. \"We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understood that Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business in North America and Europe,\" said Fildes. He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has a major joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of its own in that market.  Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own business. Many large corporations have invested in small biotech firms. But Squibb's investment in Cetus is the first it has made in biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to Cetus because it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationship with a large number of other biotechnology companies.\"  Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug areas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to \"keep the biggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves.\" Fildes said the partnership with Squibb would be used to broaden the company's reach in such big money making areas as the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatory markets. Squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in Cetus' research over the next five years.  \"Squibb is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research and development to make it happen, while the equity position part of the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this partnership,\" said Fildes.

Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87 due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterological sub-divisions of the country. The report gave the targets for various crops with estimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following, in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grains including sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13). Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it was possible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifying growing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said. The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along with greater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement in fertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, adding total foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84 respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4 mln. India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnes of foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-year development plan ending March 31, 1990. Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the 1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gap of 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining three years of the plan by increasing grain output annually by more than nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only with good weather, the report said. \"The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water (irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread of improved technology including timely use of inputs (farm materials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to be vigrously pursued,\" it said.  ",

  "text": "BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> HEARING TO CONTINUE TOMORROW U.S. District Court Judge Eugene A. Gordon said he plans to issue a decision tomorrow on Burlington Industries Inc's request for an injunction to stop Samjens Acquisition Corp's takeover bid for the company. Wall Street sources have said the outcome of the case could be pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeover battle for Burlington, the largest u.s. textile maker. Gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyers for Burlington and Samjens, a partnership formed by Dominion Textile Inc and New York investor Asher Edelman. Hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow. A preliminary injunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer until the case is decided. Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlr buyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc &lt;MS>, one dlr per share lower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjens last week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjens offer. Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman and Dominion used illegally obtained confidential information about the company in making their takeover attempt.  That information, Burlington said, was provided by James Ammeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23 years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington's sales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November, 1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never to divulge inside information about the company. Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he began working with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to \"takeover the company, dismember the company and displace its management,\" Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said. Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information from PaineWebber, but argued the information was public information and could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts or Burlington's public financial statements. Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met with Edelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet with them until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion went public April 24 with their intention to take over the company. Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt a takeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board in February. Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion held discussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting as financial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke off because Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman and dominion with a written statement that they did not provide inside information. Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeen withdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairman Frank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive and threatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in an effort to takeover Burlilgnton. \"The ultimate question is not the price per share or the profit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct for those who would takeover an American company,\" said burlington lawyer Humphrey. Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as the largest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be in violation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada's largest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plants in Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market, the lawyers said. Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said the market for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contends and that Burlington has the ability to switch between light weight and heavy weight denim production as demand and price dictate. Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed by Burlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bid for Dominion. \"Surely, what would have been sauce for the goose would have been sauce for the gander,\" said Sidney Rosdeitcher, a Samjens lawyer.

  "text": "EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE European currency markets reacted quietly to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to surprise that the markets should have expected so much. The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it. Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining broadly entrenched in its current trading range. \"The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84 marks,\" said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs. However, she said the dollar could break out of the range with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S. Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday. Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen, possibly to 140 yen. A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term. London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank operators to test the downside. Concern that finance ministers and officials still in Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the near term, the traders said. Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's downward trend. Traders in several centres said the market would look for fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to defend current ranges, which the communique said were \"broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.\" Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said \"They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon.\" The U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said. However, some dealers said London-based operators would be unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825 marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen. Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme volatility seen in the first few months of this year. One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the communique made clear the leading nations did not want a further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar. The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to 1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre accord's supposed currency target range. A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were ready for a period of \"mainly sideways movement.\" But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique contributing to greater stability. \"Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big boost,\" said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks in the next three months. A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said the communique had been in line with realistic expectations and should not have produced disappointment. \"The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade policies to redress current imbalances are of a different timescale than currency markets operate on,\" the source told Reuters, \"This is a political process which takes time.\" Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp in Basle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on currency markets today. \"Did people really expect a patent remedy?\" he asked. Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was only the first in a series and said the market would watch carefully in the next few weeks for any changes in positions. A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus was now on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move by Japan and West Germany to boost their economic growth could lead to a quick change in the U.S. Position. Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in pushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months while central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to support the Paris accord.

  "text": "TREASURY'S BAKER UNDER FIRE FOR WALL STREET DROP As official Washington sought to restore investor confidence after Monday's Wall Street collapse, Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire from critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis. Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank for boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an international accord to stabilize currency values. Nigel Lawson, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, was among those who said the treasury secretary's statements helped spur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors think that a clash between the two major economic powers would damage the world economy. Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday, \"I think the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That, I think, was partly due to statements that have been made by senior figures on the other side of the Atlantic.\" It was a dispute that should never have happened, he added. Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at a hastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the United States on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip to Scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis. Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, \"His timing could not have been worse.\" One government bond salesman in New York said, \"He actually thought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smack the dollar down would work. That doesn't show much understanding of international monetary gamesmanship.\" However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn march toward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand. \"On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but if you go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial markets), it was West German policy,\" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International in New York. \"All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, so making him responsible for it was a little like killing the messenger,\" he said. After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governments made it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced together in Paris in February, was still in effect. Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be a prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to the late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crash wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values. Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy about Bonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the global recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interest rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite. He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59th month, could no longer be the only engine of global economic expansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a huge market for debtor country exports. Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worried that the Republican party might face next year's presidential election with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly tarnished. A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt crisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that has already slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate. \"There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the economy, and it's important that the psychology turn around quickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, and eventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,\" former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a television interview. In many ways, the official response was mild. Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat, with President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting that he was \"puzzled.\" U.S. government sources said the secretary immediately returned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments and, presumably, their political impact. For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status in Washington will diminish because of the market fall. Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because of the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen said with some irony, \"Oh, I think it's much too late to be doing that...You have an administration that's taken the attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and --- retire to the living room to take a nap. You just can't do that.\"  ",

MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S. And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians, they said. \"The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,\" said one diplomatic source. \"They are a potent political force,\" the diplomatic source said. But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts said. \"The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not so internationalized,\" said Waseda University professor Mitsuru Uchida. \"Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world community and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how to face the situation.\" Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with London over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in Japan's lucrative overseas telephone business. The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now monopolizes the business. It has also opposed a major management role in the planned merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on the grounds that no such international precedent exists. The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which has threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger plan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open its telecommunications market. Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's car telephone and satellite communications market. Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the sector it regulates. \"What has been happening is an important shift in the economy which makes the ministry a very important place,\" said James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory Service Inc. A decision to open the telecommunications industry to competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted rather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said. \"With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto legal framework,\" said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell Whitten. Close links with the powerful political faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, the analysts said. \"Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance of MPT,\" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of the influential political group, he added. The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the Postal Savings System, analysts said. MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal Savings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than banks, they said. Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT's obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized the ministry as feudal. Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said. But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world including Britain, several analysts said. \"The United States is really the odd man out,\" Abegglen said. \"For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable view,\" he said.

A Foreign Ministry statement said the latest crisis between the two NATO members stemmed from the continental shelf dispute and an agreement on this issue would effect the security, economy and other rights of both countries. \"As the issue is basicly political, a solution can only be found by bilateral negotiations,\" the statement said. Greece has repeatedly said the issue was legal and could be solved at the International Court of Justice. The two countries approached armed confrontation last month after Greece announced it planned oil exploration work in the Aegean and Turkey said it would also search for oil. A face-off was averted when Turkey confined its research to territorrial waters. \"The latest crises created an historic opportunity to solve the disputes between the two countries,\" the Foreign Ministry statement said. Turkey's ambassador in Athens, Nazmi Akiman, was due to meet Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou today for the Greek reply to a message sent last week by Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Ozal.

They said the president's Economic Policy Council looked at Japan's adherence to the 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact yesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly. But there was no hint what the announcement might be. Officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese exports could be modified if Japan was found to be honoring a portion of its semiconductor pact. But they also noted that the White House has said it was unlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of the world's seven major economic powers in Venice on June 8-10. The officials added that while the curbs complicated U.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was not taking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit. Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation for Japan's failure to honor commitments to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than production costs and to open its own market to U.S. goods. The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese television sets, personal computers and hand-held power tools. Reagan, in imposing the curbs, said they would be lifted as soon as there was evidence of a pattern that Japan was adhering to the pact.  ",

  "text": "SMUGGLING BLAMED FOR CLOSURE OF HAITIAN SUGAR FIRM A sugar mill which was this nation's second largest employer closed its doors yesterday, saying it had been run out of business by sugar smuggled from Miami and the neighbouring Dominican Republic. The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO) will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to 40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital, the company said. \"Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCO regrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar cane after April 10,\" the mill warned planters earlier this week. Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteen months ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cooking oil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumer prices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwing hundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work. At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up to receive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed a warehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound (45-kg) bags of sugar. \"We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar. We have no money left to continue operations,\" Rigaud said. He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed an additional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers. Rigaud blamed the mill's problems on an order by Duvalier two years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar. He said the government then began importing refined sugar at world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit and the provisional military-civilian government that replaced Duvalier last year continued the policy. \"But now with all the smuggling even the state can't compete with smuggled Dominican refined sugar,\" Rigaud said. HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably above the usual minimum wage of three dlrs. It is generally estimated that every employed Haitian supports at least six people. Rigaud said HASCO's closing at a minimum would affect 280,000 to 300,000 people. Laid-off workers were bitter about the closure. \"We're dead, and it's the government that's causing us to die,\" declared Lucien Felix, 34, who has five dependents.  ",

The cuts take the one month rate to 6.75 pct, the two month rate to 6.80 pct and the key three month rate to 6.85 pct, the central bank said in a telex. A National Bank spokesman said the modest cut was made after a decline in domestic money market rates yesterday, and was not expected to be followed by a cut in the 7.60 pct discount rate. The short-term treasury certificate rates, and especially the three-month rate, have been the National Bank's main monetary policy instrument for the last two years. The discount rate has been the market's penalty rate rather than a guiding rate since 1985, and its advances are currently little used as liquidity is ample, bank economists said. The bank last cut one- to three-month certificate rates on June 5, also by 0.10 points.  ",

Dome said in the filing that its debt plan proposes making payments under a five year income debenture to the lender whose debt is secured by Dome's Encor shares. After the five years are up, \"under certain circumstances the shares of Encor may be required to be disposed,\" the company said. Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for part of its debt to &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>, estimated last year at 947 mln dlrs. Analysts have said Commerce Bank was pressing Dome to sell the stock to pay down its debt. Dome's Encor shares had a market value of 313 mln dlrs on March 17, 1987, the company's filing said. As previously reported, Dome is seeking approval in principle for the debt restructuring plan. Dome said in the filing it proposed lenders sign a letter of understanding in early April, with implementation to be effective July 1, 1987. Dome Petroleum reiterated in the SEC filing that its existence as a going concern is dependent on continuing the interim debt plan, due to expire on June 30, and winning agreement for its proposed restructuring plan. \"The company believes that the negotiation and implementation of the proposed debt restructuring plan is realistic and achievable,\" Dome said. \"However, the final outcome of the negotiations cannot be predicted at this time,\" it said.

  "text": "TAIWAN ANNOUNCES NEW ROUND OF IMPORT TARIFF CUTS Taiwan announced plans for another round of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade talks with Washington which officials described as a move to help balance trade with the United States. Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of products included 60 items asked by Washington. \"The move is part of our government efforts to encourage imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United States,\" he said. He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles, apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut by between five and 50 pct. The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting on April 20, he added. Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700 foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's largest trading partner. Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade deficit with Taipei. Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78 billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show. Today's announcement came before a departure later today of a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of trade talks with U.S. Officials. The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last night he was leaving with \"a heavy heart,\" meaning that he would face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada. Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S. Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products, purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment, import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property. \"I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from our talks with the U.S.,\" he said without elaborating.

They said the agreement followed months of talks with the Soviet Union and the U.S. On ways to secure its oil exports after Iran started to attack Kuwaiti-connected vessels in retaliation for Kuwait's backing for Iran's war enemy Iraq. Diplomats said they expect three Soviet tankers initially to reinforce other flags already supporting Kuwait's 22-tanker fleet. The diplomats said they knew of no deal for Moscow to provide a naval escort for its own vessels, but \"the idea of protection is implicit,\" one said. They said Soviet cargo ships bound for Kuwait in the past to unload arms and materiel for road delivery to Iraq were known to have sailed under escort. So far, none of the Soviet ships are known to have been attacked by Iran. Diplomats said they expected the chartered Soviet tankers to sail between Kuwait and Khor Fakkan on the United Arab Emirates (UAE) coast a short way outside the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the Gulf.

A short time later, Navy personnel boarded a second Iranian oil platform about five miles to the north and destroyed radar and communications equipment before leaving the structure, the Pentagon said. Defense Department spokesman Fred Hoffman told reporters that the second platform had been abandoned by Iranian personnel during the shelling and destruction of the first rig.

CEPE manager Carlos Romoleroux told reporters that Ecuador would begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude in northeastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week in preparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link-up to neighbouring Colombia. Oil production in Ecuador was halted on March five when an earthquake damaged the country's main pipeline from Lago Agrio, at the heart of the Ecuadorean jungle oilfields, to the pacific port of Balao. It will take at least until the end of July to repair the pipeline and return output to normal levels. The country was pumping between 245,000 bpd and 250,000 bpd before the tremor. To resume limited output in the meantime, Ecuador is constructing a 26 mile pipeline linkup, capable of carrying 55,000 bpd, from Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon, the starting point of Colombia's pipeline to the Pacific port of Tumaco. The original target date to resume limited crude output was May eight, the scheduled date for the inauguration of the Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline, an energy ministry spokesman said.  ",

IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying on his return to Tehran from Moscow that the agreement was part of a protocol on economic cooperation signed during his visit. The amount of crude delivered to the Soviet Union might double to 200,000 bpd later, he said. Aqazadeh said the two sides agreed to conduct feasibility studies for a pipeline to take Iranian crude from fields in southern Iran to the Black Sea through the Soviet Union. Iran is pursuing the pipeline project to protect part of its oil exports from Iraqi air attacks in the Gulf. Irna made no mention of natural gas exports to the Soviet Union, which Aqazadeh had said would be discussed before he left for Moscow. Iran lost most of its refining capacity early in the Gulf war and now imports several hundred thousand bpd of refined products. Aqazadeh said Soviet refined products would be delivered at the Caspian Sea ports of Anzali and Nowshahr, at Neka, near the Caspian, and at Jolfa in north-west Iran.  ",

In an article headlined, \"Gulf oil sources say Middle East production up 1.4 mln bpd,\" it warned OPEC's official prices could face fresh pressure from international oil companies seeking cheaper supplies. It did not say whether only OPEC or both OPEC and other producers were behind the reported rise in Mideast output. Nor did it specify if the sources were official or other contacts. \"The sources said the credibility of OPEC would come under fresh scrutiny from today (Monday), with activity in the European and American markets,\" the daily said. The sources were quoted as saying that after OPEC had in March demonstrated its commitment to quota agreements, some members had raised output last week. It gave no details. \"Dealers in oil markets were now waiting to see if Opec was able to control production, or whether the days of cheating and producing over quotas has begun anew,\" it said. The sources warned that \"maybe the (price of a) barrel of oil will fall below 18, perhaps 17.80 dlrs this week or next if there is no control on supplies,\" it said. \"The sources believed a return of oil below 18 dlrs a barrel may open the doors for international oil companies to pressure OPEC over contract prices, similar to the struggle last March,\" it said, apparently referring to resistance by buyers to lift from Qatar unless it gave price discounts. \"More than one official has warned OPEC would find its solidarity under scrutiny by the end of April or start of May,\" it said, noting demand usually fell with the onset of summer.

The two sides usually try to meet as each new year of the agreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed up to last February. However, any delay this year should not endanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extends through September, 1988, USDA officials said. \"It will be difficult to pull together the people for the meeting during July,\" an aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said. Since the last meeting was only around four months ago, the next talks could still be a \"couple more months,\" he said.  There has been grain industry speculation that the USDA will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy during the next marketing year. But USDA officials said even if consultations were held soon a subsidy offer would probably not be made. \"I doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this summer or before the next agreement year begins,\" a USDA source said. Citing limited subsidy funds and uncertainties about next year's crops, he said, \"There are too many variables now. It would be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now.\" Under the nonbinding pact, Moscow has agreed to purchase a minimum of nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain per year. Soviet and U.S. officials normally meet in the summer before the start of a new agreement year to discuss grain quality, shipping logistics and production outlooks.  ",

The company was appealing against a decision of the Tax Commissioners that any such provision was a capital expenditure, not a revenue expenditure, and was not deductible. The court was told that since 1976 the company had made an annual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost of abandoning a rig. An RTZ spokesman said the ruling was not worrying as the subsidiary had assumed that the provisions were not deductible from corporation tax payable. It would have been a bonus if the company had won but all budgeting had been on the assumption that it would not, he said. Oil analysts said that RTZ's assumption of liability was shared by the industry as a whole. The ruling appeared to mean that tax relief on the expensive process of abandoning rigs would apply when the expense occurred, not when provisions for future expenses were built into the accounts, one analyst added.

  "text": "U.S. ECONOMY SLOWDOWN RAISES RECESSION FEARS The economy faces lackluster growth and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement in U.S. exports should falter, economists say. Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further hampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say. \"These factors raise the question: Is there enough strength to keep the economy from tipping into a recession?\" said Lyle Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association and a former Federal Reserve Board official. The Commerce Department said this week that the economy grew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, but a U.S. monetary official called it a weak report. Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spending rose a weak 0.1 per cent. \"Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing -- are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, \" Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics, told Reuters. Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow because inflation is rising faster than real wages. To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise, returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost personal income and consumption, he says. \"I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to keep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,\" Gramley said. Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters that the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was the result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last and said the recovery was showing anemia. Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, \"The pace of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into monetary policy\" - possibly a signal that the Fed will be accommodative. Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct forecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if the dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and add to the risk of a recession. Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in May came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where an inventory overhang still exists. He says the boost in production came from smaller industries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which have improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar. \"They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in economic activity, but I think they will keep us out of a recession,\" Mauro said. In a speech to financial planners this week, Beryl Sprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted the trade deficit will continue to improve. \"Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and into 1988 are still quite favorable,\" he said. But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in inflation. Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5 to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after a 1.1 pct increase in 1986. The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oil and energy prices and rising prices for services, he said. \"The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets out of the bottle, it continues to persist,\" he said, adding he would like the Fed to tighten credit. A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the dollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, says a prominent international banker. Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the National Press Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen and the mark will continue for years because the United States is the world's largest debtor nation. The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a further slackening of activity and called naive the belief that the five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever. \"It is very difficult to be optimistic,\" Gut said.

  "text": "PHELPS DODGE &lt;PD> SEES STRONGER COPPER PRICES Phelps Dodge Corp officials said good fundamentals in copper markets should lead to improving prices for the metal. In an interview with Reuters, chairman G. Robert Durham said continued strong demand and low inventories pushed prices up eight to nine pct on the New York Commodities Exchange last month. \"Our customers in this country are living off the tailgates of our trucks,\" he said, referring to tightness of supply and strong demand. \"The fundamentals are good.\"  Asked if metal prices will continue to rise, Durham said; \"All I know is, fundamentals cannot be ignored.\" He said copper supplies are lower than they have been for almost 20 years. Last year, copper demand was second highest on record behind 1984, he said. Phelps Dodge is the nation's largest copper company, with annual production expected to reach 500,000 tons this year.  During the interview, executive vice president Douglas Yearley said he believed it was only a matter of time before the copper price rose \"because there aren't that many new projects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession, will continue to grow modestly.\" Copper for July delivery rose more than two cts a pound to more than 69 cents in Comex trading today. A one cent a pound rise in copper prices yields 10 mln dlrs in annual earnings for Phelps Dodge, the company said. \"Demand has been surprisingly good in 1987, in construction and other areas,\" Yearley said.  New production later this year from a Bingham, Utah, mine owned by Kennecott Corp, a unit of British Petroleum Co PLC's &lt;BP> Standard Oil Co, a mine in New Guinea and Phelps Dodge's own expanded Morenci, Ariz., mine will be offset by production shortfalls in Mexico and Zambia, he said. Durham said production costs at the New Mexico-located Chino mine will be in line with conventional copper production at the company's other mines by the fourth quarter. The company's total production costs, including depreciation but before interest and corporate expense, should be below 50 cts a pound by late 1989 or 1990, he said.  ",

  "text": "ASA SAYS EC OILSEED POLICY ILLEGAL UNDER GATT The American Soybean Association (ASA) denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and threatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does not remedy the situation. ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsored Outlook 87 conference: \"It will be filed unless the EC takes drastic and immediate steps.\" \"These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal, since they were established after the zero soybean duty was established in 1962,\" he said. The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would ask for an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies to make the regime non-discriminatory. The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, in an effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds production has risen dramatically since then. The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world market levels and is considering implementing a controversial oils and fats tax. The subsidies \"are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero duty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell,\" Adams said. The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support its trade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes an EC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the EC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December. U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in volume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result of EC policies, Adams added. Lord Plumb, European Parliament President and a speaker at the conference, said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973 when the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products.  ",

As previously reported, the region has been undergoing a severe dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, since December, following the virtual failure of the summer wet season. Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth since the rains began, the spokesman said from Brisbane. Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much better than it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesman said. But is too early to say what they will be and more rain is needed to restore sub-soil moisture. Elsewhere, in far north Queensland, the Bundaberg region and southern Queensland, the cane is in excellent condition and some mills are forecasting record crops, he said. Initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiled towards the end of May, he said. The cane crush normally runs from June to December.  ",

The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about 20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop. It said generally favorable weather from early December through February helped compensate for earlier dryness. However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the report said. The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create serious storage problems, the report said. Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are expected to be above average, it said. Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop crop has been harvested. During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, the report said. New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Parana accounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasons for the decline are expected reduced government support price and good summer crop harvests.  ",

After Rorer announced its second bid for the company last Thursday, analysts forecast that the Robins family, which holds control of the company, would vigourously oppose any merger. But, the analysts added, that Robins desire to emerge independent from two years of bankruptcy proceedings may be thwarted by some Robins' shareholders who perceive a merger as a more expedient way of dealing with the company's Dalkon Shield related liabilities. After a failed first attempt earlier this year, Rorer's latest merger plan calls for a share swap worth about 720 mln dlrs.

Anderson said. \"It's going to come sooner than anyone thinks,\" Anderson told reporters after addressing a Houston business lunch. \"I believe we're going to see a change in the world oil markets in two to three years because oil is becoming harder to find.\" Anderson, who retired from Arco last year to form Hondo Oil and Gas Co, said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mln barrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about 4.5 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear. \"If you looked around the world, you could not scrape up one mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the Middle East,\" he said. \"We're soon going to be right back where we were in 1973 and 1979.\" Anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 at about 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb. \"There's no way prices can stay flat because there isn't enough supply,\" he said. \"There have been no major oil discoveries for the past 15 to 20 years.\" Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil reserves, the last major world discovery, has already produced about five billion barrels of oil or more than half of its estimated reserves, he said.

Figures in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda show industrial production rose 3.6 pct in the first nine months of 1987 against 5.2 pct in the same 1986 period. Foreign trade in the same period fell 3.6 pct from the 1986 period as exports fell by 0.5 pct and imports dropped by 4.2 pct. Foreign trade in the nine months totalled 94.2 billion roubles. Separate import and export figures were not given. One factor affecting industrial growth was the introduction of a new quality control plan, Western economists said. Last year's calculations of industrial output included all goods, irrespective of quality. Under the new plan, introduced in line with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's drive to modernise the economy, special inspectors have the right to reject goods they consider below standard. Pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods were rejected in the nine-month period. The figures also showed that on October 1, there were more than 8,000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80,000 people. More than 200,000 were employed in the private sector, Pravda said, without giving comparative figures. The promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of the economy has been an important part of the modernisation campaign, with measures introduced recently to allow the setting up of small shops on a private basis. Labour productivity rose 3.7 pct in the first nine months against 4.8 pct growth in January to September 1986. But western economists said they treat Soviet productivity figures with caution, as they are more broadly based than in the West, which measures worker output over a given period. Pravda said there were 283.8 mln people in the Soviet Union as of October 1. In the January to September 1987 period 118.5 mln people were employed, a rise of 4.4 pct on the same period last year. Average earnings were 200 roubles a month against 194 roubles a year ago.  ",

They also said the EC would be in breach of an undertaking not to bring in new protectionist measures during the current Punta del Este round of world trade negotiations being held under GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) auspices. The EC Commission has proposed a tax of up to 330 European currency units (Ecus) a tonne on both imported and EC-produced vegetable and marine fats for human consumption, which could raise up to two billion Ecus a year. EC farm ministers, who would have to approve such a tax, are split on the issue and are expected to decide it at a marathon meeting on EC farm prices beginning in Luxembourg on June 15. Jamaican ambassador Leslie Wilson said ACP countries are convinced this would lead to EC industry substituting products made within the bloc for oil and fat imports. The ACP estimates this would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln Ecus in its member country exports. \"We can't believe the EC would willingly take measures to undermine our countries, but such would be the impact of these measures,\" Wilson said. The U.S. and Malaysia say their exports would also be hit by the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if it is approved. Wilson said the ACP would take such steps only \"as a very last resort,\" but added that the ACP is in touch with other countries which oppose the plan. Wilson, who was chairing the news conference, made it clear Jamaica itself would not be hit by the tax as it does not export oils and fats. Among the worst hit countries would be Ivory Coast, Senegal, Nigeria and Papua New Guinea, the ACP says.  ",

  "text": "TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS SYSTEM NEEDS STABILITY Treasury Secretary James Baker said the floating exchange rate system has not been as effective as had been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalances from emerging in the global economy. In remarks before the afternoon session of the International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee, Baker said he was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned. \"But I do suggest,\" he said, \"that we need something to give it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction when the wind shifts.\" He said that indicators can serve \"as a kind of compass\" but added that structural indicators can help focus attention on some policies. Baker, however, said the IMF \"needs to move beyond macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific relevance to the imbalances we face today.\" The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be given a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- Article IV consultations -- that the Fund performs. Baker also told the policy making group that it was time for the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMF surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the public. \"In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMF appraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use of follow-up reports on country actions to implement IMF recommendations, and greater use of special consultation procedures,\" he said. Baker emphasized that indicators were a device \"for moving beyond rhetoric to action.\" He said they provide \"more structure to the system, and induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of policy coordination.\" He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to be reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators. \"This should be matter of priority for the executive board,\" he said. Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternative medium-term economic scenarios for countries that \"can help us focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, by identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the implications of these options.\" He said also that further work should be done on finding paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives. \"If we are to take effective remedial action when there are significant deviations from an intended course, then we must have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for key variables,\" he said.

The stalemate over farm prices is seen as a key to providing a solution to a long-term settlement of the Community's worst-ever budget crisis. \"The Germans clearly do not want to budge,\" an aide to Chirac told reporters. He added the French Prime Minister was visibly angered as he the hour-long meeting. Bonn and Paris are diametrically opposed to a proposal for the Brussels Executive Commission to overhaul radically the EC's complex \"green\" currrency system, designed to translate common EC farm prices into national currencies. Paris also supports a move for an oils and fats tax which West Germany is against, along with Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands. EC farm minsters are due to resume negotiations on the package, which should have been agreed by an April 1 deadline tomorrow. Diplomats said it had been hoped that the summit could have injected fresh impetus into those talks. The Commission proposed its package to save one billion dollars on the EC's ever-rising farm budget. The summit has been dominated by lengthy talks on moves to alter the entire system of financing the 12-nation group, and plugging a 5.7 billion dollar budget shortfall for 1987.  ",

MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energy supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600 mln, they said. The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in Japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen and a decline in domestic electric power demand. MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said. They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas. Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan's electric power in the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27 pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) and liquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.

Earlier today in Washington, U.S. Television networks had reported that American forces launched a retaliatory strike against Iran late Sunday, attacking two Iranian offshore oil drilling platforms and setting them ablaze. The shipping sources said Iran's Sassan, Rostam and Rakhsh offshore oilfields were attacked at 0700 local (0300 GMT) by a wave of jet fighter bombers. Smoke was seen spiralling up from the Rostam field soon after. At least one of the other two targets was also believed to be ablaze, the sources said. The Sassan and Rostam fields have been targets for Iraqi air strikes in the past, but Baghdad had not reported any southern Gulf missions prior to news of the latest attack. Shipping and military sources in the region have said Iran used its southern Gulf rigs as bases to launch helicopter and later speedboat attacks on neutral ships in the waterway. U.S. Officials had been meeting on a response since Friday when an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a U.S.-flagged ship. President Reagan said on Sunday he had already made a decision on the U.S. Response to Friday's Iran attack but would not say what the decision was.  ",

The suit, filed in Manhattan, also names First Boston Corp &lt;FBC> and seeks to void the issue by Harcourt of 40,000 shares of super voting preferred stock to First Boston Securities Corp and the issue of convertible voting preferred stock with 4,700,000 votes in the Harcourt employee stock ownership plan. The preferred shares to be issued to First Boston have 8,160,000 votes. The suit, brought derivatively on behalf of Harcourt and individually in British Printing's capacity as a substantial holder of Harcourt common shares and 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures. The suit alleges Harcourt's special dividend exceeds by more than one billion dlrs Harcout's surplus available for dividends under New York law and contstitutes a fraudulent conveyance. The lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose that one consequence of the payment of the dividend, which it terms illegal, will be that shareholders will be liable to repay it. Harcourt last week said it would pay 40 dlrs per share to stockholders as a special dividend. Harcourt also announced an extensive recapitalization plan, which analysts said was aimed at thwarting a takeover effort by British Printing. British Printing last week withdrew its 44 dlr per share, or two billion dlr offer for Harcourt because of the recapitalizaton plan. At the time, it said it was reviewing its alternatives. British Printing said it filed the suit after consultation with its advisers. Its lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose the effect of the special dividend on Harcourt 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures. British Printing alleges the effect will be an enormous increase effective on the June eight record date for the dividend in the number of Harcourt common shares issuable upon conversion of the debentures. British Printing also charged Harcourt is unlawfully coercing debenture holders to convert denbentures before the record date because Harcourt may not have enough authorized common shares to honor conversion after the date. British Printing holds 460,600 shares and 5.6 mln dlrs worth of debentures. The suit also alleges that management, the board of directors, and First Boston engaged in an illegal scheme of entrenchment through a combination of selling to First Boston Securities Corp the super voting preferred at a bargain price, the grant to the company employee stock plan of convertible voting preferred, the six mln share open market repurchase program and the manner in which its financing has been structured.

The Bank of Korea today quoted the won unchanged at 812.05 against the dollar, a 6.02 pct gain so far this year compared with a 3.34 pct increase for the whole of 1986.

The harvest will be China's second highest in history but poor weather and low incentives for grain-producing farmers have kept yields down, earlier Chinese press reports said. Industry sources expect China to import at least 10 mln tonnes of grain this year because of the harvest shortfall. Chinese customs figures showed grain imports of 9.59 mln tonnes in the first eight months of 1987, compared with 6.09 mln in the same 1986 period. Agriculture Minister He Kang said last month state prices for grain purchase from growers were to be adjusted to increase the incentive for grain production. China could not afford to become a major food importer, he said. The State Statistics Bureau spokesman also said China's 1987 cotton output was expected to rise 10 pct over 1986 to 390 mln tonnes.

But he said the U.S. Would not lift the selective economic sanctions it imposed on Japanese imports in April until Tokyo changed its sales policies concerning computer microchips. Speaking in a televised news conference linking several European capitals, Shultz said it was heartening that the Japanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic and global demand.  \"There is an even greater amount of stimulus than was originally thought,\" said Shultz, speaking from Washington. \"It is a lot more than nothing. It is more than was talked about when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here. \"It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believe that getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the economy,\" he added. But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the news conference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Might decide at next week's Venice summit to lift its sanctions on some Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied: \"These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an agreement that had been reached between the United States and Japan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip market. \"They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to the agreement that it made become evident.\" He said U.S. Officials had only been able to monitor the situation for a month and that it was impossible to determine a trend on only one month's data. The U.S. Imposed 100 pct import duties on personal computers, colour televisions and power tools, alleging that Japan had violated last September's bilateral agreement by selling computer chips at below fair market value. Shultz said West Germany and other nations would also do well to look at what they could do to stimulate demand. Asked whether the U.S. Could reasonably ask its allies to take action to stimulate the world economy without a bold American initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget deficit, Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the problem. He said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficit would probably be reduced by around 35 billion dlrs against last year, and that the budget being worked on this year would contain a major reduction.

Suhud said. The Japanese Export-Import Bank said Indonesia had raised its share of (P.T. Indonesia Asahan Aluminium) company, capitalised in 1975 at 91 billion, by swapping 32 billion yen in government loans to the company for an equity stake. The Japanese shareholders, the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and 12 companies, are to invest another 24 billion yen raising capitalisation to 147 billion yen. Asahan reported total losses of 97.6 billion rupiah between 1982 and 1985. Suhud said much of the company's 320 billion yen debt had been caused by falling tin prices and the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. Dollar. Aluminium is sold in dollars. Prices improved from 1,150 dlrs a tonne six months ago to about 1,450 dlrs today. The plant is supposed to break even if prices stay at 1,500 dlrs a tonne. Sahud said the plant, with a capacity of 220,000 tonnes a year, would probably lose money again in 1987. The plant, situated in North Sumatra, produces mostly for Japan.  ",

  "text": "GERMAN BANKERS' REMARKS REVIVE TALK OF RATE CUT Remarks by two leading central bankers sparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut in the West German three pct discount rate may be under discussion, currency dealers said. Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech that monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows required cuts in interest rates. Separately, West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below its lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he was not making a forecast on interest rates, however. Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollar gained slight background support from the speculation. But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80 pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money market this week, dashing some expectations that it may either offer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate and let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate. It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much less than the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact expired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank could move to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said. Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculative capital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless of whether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell. \"In other words, the monetary policy measures required are different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to -- those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity.\" Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of the generally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked the first time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a counterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said.

In a speech prepared for delivery as the United States made plans to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers from Iranian attack, Reagan said the American people were aware that \"it is not our interests alone that are being protected.\" Saying that allied dependence on gulf oil was no secret, Reagan declared, \"During the upcoming summit in Venice, we will be discussing the common security interests shared by the western democracies in the MIDEAST Gulf. \"The future belongs to the brave. Free men should not cower before such challenges, and they should not expect to stand alone.\" Reagan will meet the leaders of Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan at the economic summit, which will take place in Venice June 8-10.  The 13th annual top-level meeting of the major industrial democracies will take place against a backdrop of rising congressional concern over Reagan's plan to protect gulf shipping and demands that the allies do more. These concerns were heightened by the May 17 Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark which killed 37 seamen. \"They died while guarding a chokepoint of freedom, deterring aggression and reaffirming America's willingness to protect its vital interests,\" Reagan said.  In a pre-summit speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Marshall Plan, Reagan, who spoke to an audience of foreign affairs experts, also pledged to push for economic expansion by West Germany and Japan to bolster the world trading system. \"While the vibrancy of the U.S. economy has contributed enormously to the world expansion, preserving a growing world economy is the business of every member of the world trading community,\" he said.  \"It will be made clear, especially to our friends in Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany, that growth-oriented domestic policies are needed to bolster the world trading system on which they depend.\" Reagan coupled this appeal with a call for compliance with allied accords on exchange rate stability. \"Economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group of Seven finance ministers in Paris and in Washington cannot be ignored or forgotten,\" he said. \"The commitments made at these meetings need to be translated into action.\"  ",

Under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said it would study using the technology at the oil shale plant. In return the company would have been eligible for 500 mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supports from the U.S. Treasury Department, which took over the contract from the Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said. Unocal said its studies showed the cost for the fluidized bed combustion facility would have exceeded 352 mln dlrs, compared with an original estimate of 260 mln dlrs. The fluidized bed facility would have provided heat and electricity for the oil shale project, Unocal said. Last year's fall in oil prices and the loss of investment tax credit under the Tax Reform Act made the project uneconomical even with government price supports and loan guarantees, Unocal said. The Parachute Creek oil shale plant produces about 4,000 to 5,000 barrels per day of crude shale oil, Unocal said.  ",

  "text": "SOSNOFF RAISES BID FOR CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW> Investor Martin T. Sosnoff said he has raised his offer for Caesars World Inc shares to 32 dlrs each from 28 dlrs and has reduced the number of shares he is seeking to 29.1 mln from all those not already owned. In a newspaper advertisement, Sosnoff said the bid by his MTS Acquisition Corp, withdrawal rights and the proration period will now expire June 19 unless extended. The offer had been scheduled to expire May 15. In late March, Sosnoff said he had received a \"negligible\" number of shares in response to the offer, which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate. Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30 mln common shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on a primary basis. Last week, Caesars' board approved a recapitalization plan as an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholders would receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subject to approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held in June. The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mln dlrs in debt to finance the payout. Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that the amended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to give him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and on the arrangement of financing, as well as to approvals by New Jersey and Nevada gaming authorities. He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring all of Caesars' shares and if successful would be followed by a merger transaction. Sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29.1 mln shares he is now seeking, together with the 4,217,675 shares he owns, would give him a 92.4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis. He said he still has received only a \"negligible\" number of shares in response to his tender. In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included in the statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April 8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing to increase the price of his offer. Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully in place. Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ> has now delivered to him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasing dividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS Holding Corp, an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition. He said Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, which leads a syndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlr margin facility, believes it will be able to arrange for further commitments under the margin facility to advance up to an additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit the purchase of shares under the offer. Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender, each of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer, or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted into Series A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby an independent investment baking firm. He said \"To the extent that fewer than 29,100,000 sdhares are purchased in the offer, the stockholders would receive a combination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a value of 32 dlrs per share of Caesars.\" Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior to Caesars' recapitalization. Sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gaming officials in Nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatory process required for regulatory approval, a process that it already underway in New Jersey. He said his offer has been extended based on the likely duration of the regulatory process. He said he intends to further extend the offer if the approval process is not completed by the expiration date.  ",

Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met at The Hague, said, \"The general argument presented by the Bank for this free trade, open economy view is weak.\" The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural growth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming. The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked and the subsidies are a waste of money. Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers, exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers. Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the government would continue to maintain production targets for \"strategic commodities\" such as rice and sugar. The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country would save money by importing the commodity. However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive. He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry develop and because of \"over-production and price intervention in the developed nations.\"  ",

  "text": "FIJI MAKES SUGAR PAYMENT TO GET HARVEST STARTED Fiji sugar farmers will receive an interim payment on the 1986 crop, four months ahead of schedule, in a move aimed at getting harvesting of the drought-hit 1987 crop under way, Governor-general Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau said. Industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 crop indicated output of 360,000 tonnes, well down on the record 501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 (May-December) crop year. The previous record was set in 1982 when Fiji produced 486,790 tonnes. For the past month Fiji sugar farmers have delayed harvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from the Governor-general to demands following the May 14 coup. Ganilau said in a statement the Fiji Sugar Corp would make a payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment for the 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growers for commencement of harvesting would be completed at all mills by June 23. Crushing would commence at Labasa and Penang mills on June 23 and at Lautoka and Rarawai mills on June 30, he said. The interim payment, to be made on or about June 30, is the full amount of the grower's share of 1986 sugar proceeds received to-date. The balance will be paid in October. Growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of 23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery to the mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlled Fiji Sugar Corp, Ganilau said. However, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of 14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of the forecast price, would be paid on December 15, on all cane harvested by November 30, he said. Ganilau said, \"This will be at least one month in advance of the expected date of payment of the second payment of cane. The balance of the second payment will be made six weeks after the end of crushing.\" Another demand of Fiji's 22,000 small farmers was that an estimated 14 mln dlr loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB) for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off. The FDB rejected this request. Ganilau said, however, \"The bank is prepared to carefully consider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases of hardship on a case-by-case basis.\" In response to a further demand that all soldiers be removed from the cane growing areas, Ganilau said the army would restrict its presence in the cane areas. He said he had directed the authorities to issue permits to harvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unions to hold the necessary meetings in preparation for the commencement of harvest. Senior representatives of the sugar cane growers had indicated a desire to commence the crush as soon as possible, he added.  ",

  "text": "PORTUGUESE ECONOMY REMAINS BUOYANT DESPITE CRISIS Portugal's economy, which has been enjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade, may now be strong enough to shrug off the country's latest government crisis, analysts said. But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva's government could slow economic reforms and investment as Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the European Community, which it joined in January last year, they said. Cavaco Silva's minority Social Democratic Party, PSD, was toppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties. The centre-right administration had made economic growth reform a priority in its 17 months in office. In 1986, Portugal's economy grew four pct, its current account surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and inflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985. Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability were worrying but they felt the foundations for continued growth had not been badly shaken. \"The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that is now less dependent on the political situation,\" said Fritz Haser, economics professor at Universidade Livre, Lisbon. \"The market doesn't see this as a real crisis yet,\" economist Jorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters. Businessmen have identified political instability over the last 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting economic progress. The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974 revolution. Portugal's developing stock markets, however, remain buoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge in economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts. Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of Portugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell, predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth would remain at similar levels this year. But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies and could slow economic development. Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the end of the month, can either call early elections or form a new government from parties in the existing left wing-dominated parliament. Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick elections as the best solution. \"There is a good chance that a majority government could result from early elections,\" Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president Pedro Ferraz da Costa said. He said they were optimistic this could mean the continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies introduced over the last year. The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, but the PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls say they could win an overall majority. A PSD majority would also open the way for more wide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws and possible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said. Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties of blocking key economic reforms. The left-wingers said Portugal's positive economic results were more the product of favourable international conditions such as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSD policies.  ",

Official sources said the bank, France's sixth largest in terms of its deposits and seventh in terms of its assets,  planned a share split to increase the number of shares on offer ahead of the sale of 40 pct of its ordinary share capital to the public, of 10 pct to staff and 20 pct abroad. Previously one of France's biggest private banks, it was nationalised by the Socialists in 1982. The sources said it was too early to give details of the planned split or of the share price, but cited April 27 as a likely date for the flotation launch. So far 30 pct of the group's capital, currently at 10.33 mln shares of 100 francs nominal, has been offered for sale to large private investors to constitute a solid core of eight to ten shareholders before the flotation. The private tender offer closes on April 16, while a 12 mln franc advertising campaign for the flotation begins on Sunday. \"The privatisation will be a way of attracting extra clients,\" CCF deputy director-general Rene de la Serre told Reuters.

Commerce Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a television broadcast that no more than one-third of the remaining 30 pct allocated to the private sector would be permitted to come from any one country. The new policy was announced some three months after the government suspended import licences and ordered an inquiry into tea purchase policy. Traders said the move was designed to put pressure on Kenya, which provided some 48 pct of Pakistan's 75-80 mln kilo annual tea imports, to buy Pakistani manufactured goods in exchange. Liptons and Brooke Bond, two units of Britain's Unilever Plc, control 95 pct of Pakistan's hard-pack tea market, traders said. Haq, who is also Planning Minister, was outlining a new three-year trade policy from the start of financial 1987/88 on July 1.  ",

  "text": "U.S. SAID TO VIEW G-7 MEETING AS MAJOR SUCCESS The United States, which has long sought Japanese action to stimulate its economy, appears to be satisfied Tokyo's latest package is a major development and allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement to stabilize currencies. Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package, announced yesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy. But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrial powers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar, the level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today. And the initial reaction of currency markets in the Far East demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals, even though the countries appear to do so. The yen sank below 145 at one point despite intervention by the Bank of Japan. Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Finance Minister, said the movement since Paris was consistent with currency trading ranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks. \"I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the discussions in Paris,\" Miyazawa said yesterday. The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of Miyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday's meetings of leading industrial nations. In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action \"extraordinary and urgent\", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality. The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to foster exchange rate stability. The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the dollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent years. Monetary sources also said they understood that Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the light of the Japanese announcement. They also said there was a growing feeling among the finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term differences in past meetings. West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like the yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of yesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other countries that its exchange rate is acceptable. Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance between West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's trade deficit have already taken place. No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut the budget deficit even though it is implied in the reafffirmation of Paris. European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are essential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year. A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would \"clearly pose substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could undermine confidence in future financial stability,\" he said. Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates. Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own currency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit. Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak dollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, the Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets. The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making their policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made. Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations. The United States and France, backed by the International Monetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or \"norms\" for a limited number of economic objectives such as growth, inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current account balances. Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in consultations between the countries on whether corrective action should be required. But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives has Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones. The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit currency fluctuations just before the February meeting. The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the relatively free currency markets of recent years.  ",

  "text": "ANALYSTS DOUBT FED FIRMED DESPITE BORROWING RISE Economists said that they doubt the Federal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despite higher discount window borrowings in the latest two-week statement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday. Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged 393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mln dlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were 1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct. \"One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but it probably isn't,\" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds. Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the two-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months. However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand often pushes up borrrowings. \"Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but it looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions late in the statement period and didn't quite make it,\" said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that the Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday. Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed. The Fed took no market reserve management action last Thursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It added temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday. Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on Tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday's overnight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs. \"It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at this time,\" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc. Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak economies in the United States and abroad and add to the financial stress of developing countries and their lenders. \"Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar tumbled,\" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch. He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new statement period began today on disappointment yesterday's Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid. In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in Wednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade imbalance between the United States and Japan. The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average Fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about where the rate has been since early November. \"I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter policy to help the dollar, as some suspect,\" said Sullivan of Dean Witter. If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has just nudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from six to 6.10 pct previously.  ",

  "text": "LATIN, CARIBBEAN NATIONS OPPOSE TRADE BILLS A group of Latin American and Caribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending in Congress, saying it would curb their exports, slow development and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt. Mario Rodriguez Montero, president of an Organization of American States special committee on trade, said he was aware of the large U.S. trade deficit, but added \"the region should not be the one affected by the trade bills.\" He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar and the budget deficit, and \"it is regrettable to solve it by a trade bill that would only serve private U.S. interests.\" Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two days of meetings with U.S. officials on trade bills now in Congress that are designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs. Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large, annual trade surpluses with the United States. Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations with large trade surpluses last year with the United States, but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2 billion dlrs, against Japan's of 58.6 billion dlrs. The European Community has also opposed the bills. Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the Reagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections in the legislation, including those to curb imports and to require retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices. He told reporters the committee would likely mount a campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate on the Senate floor, expected next week. Rodriguez said \"the region needs trade to continue development.  We hope this need will not be affected negatively by trade legislation.\" Rodriguez said: \"we need to keep the market opens - especially the U.S. market - to obtain the necessary foreign exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue national development progress.\" President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he termed \"protectionist,\" and his aides now are mounting a effort to water down some of the objectionable provisions in the legislation. Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto, Rodriguez said as yet \"the administration is not in a veto frame of mind.\"  ",

Local mines cut combined daily tin concentrate sales to Thaisarco, a Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AS> unit, to less than 20 tonnes earlier this month from a previous 40 to 45 tonne average, commercial manager Yoot Eamsa-ard told Reuters. He said the cuts resulted from a government decision to let the temporary business and municipal tax reductions on exported tin lapse on June 3. The taxes, levied on the tin mines, rose to 4.4 pct this month from 1.1 pct ad valorem over the past year. The lower levels had been introduced last year as a temporary move to aid the tin industry after prices collapsed in late 1985. Yoot said Thaisarco had to dig into its stocks to meet a large portion of new overseas orders which were averaging 100 tonnes per day. As a result, he said, Thailand could fail to fill some 3,000 tonnes of its 19,000 tonne tin export quota allocated by the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) for the year ending February 1988. Reduced tin exports this year could cause the ATPC to allocate a lower quota next year, Yoot said. The supplies shortage should prove temporary, however, because the Thai cabinet is expected to review a Mineral Resources Department proposal to reinstate the low taxes late this month, Yoot said. The department said Thailand exported 7,715 tonnes of tin during January/May compared with 8,462 tonnes a year ago.  ",

The plan is being developed in conjunction with the ECGD and the Bank of England. Neither the ECGD nor the Bank of England would comment on the plan. However, bankers said one of the main points under discussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ECGD's medium term credit portfolio in the international capital markets.  The proposals involve introducing a set of interest margins on ECGD backed debt of 5/16 to 7/8 pct, depending on the size and maturity of the credit and the currency. The banks are likely to push for a higher margin. Bankers said that while these rates would reduce a bank's return they would still be more than those proposed about a year ago when the government attempted unsuccessfully to initiate another cost reduction plan. At the same time, the banks would be expected to allow the ECGD to realise additional savings by refinancing existing government backed credit in the capital markets.  On credits that are refinanced an original lender would receive a residual margin of 7/16 pct for loans up to 10 mln stg and 3/16 pct on larger transactions.  ",

Iraq said it had foiled a three-pronged thrust some 10 km (six miles) from Basra, but admitted the Iranians had occupied ground held by the Mohammed al-Qassem unit, one of three divisions attacked.

In a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at the U.S. Treasury that ended last night, the ministers said the value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct now, and they welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese to boost their economy. West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it a \"good meeting\" and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome. Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign exchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan intervened again to prevent the yen rising too quickly. The communique said, \"The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting. They agreed, however, that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances.\" It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the communique termed \"extraordinary and urgent measures\" including an \"unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.\" The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought together ministers and central bank governors of the seven major industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment on cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Paris when they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the then-current levels. In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fall against the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at around postwar lows. Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United States and European countries for its only modest efforts to open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its exports. The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not elaborate. It said the officials \"reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.\"  ",

  "text": "CURRENCY MOVES MAY BE HURTING WORLD TRADE Japanese trade figures are seriously challenging the entrenched view of policy makers of the Group of Seven industrialised nations that relative currency rates are the key to smoothing world trade problems. Senior Japanese, U.S. And European officials in Tokyo say they are at a loss to fully explain the data, for if currencies are the key they ask, why then are are U.S. Exports to Japan shrinking? What if manipulating currencies and driving the dollar down made world trade problems worse rather than solving them, fulfilling Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's forecast of world trade recession? U.S.-Japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollar fall against the yen since the September 1985 Group of Five pact in New York. The lower dollar ought to have made U.S. Exports 40 pct more competitive in Japan. The officials, most of them economists, can offer no objective reason why they are not. Worse, how are European Community sales to Japan rising rapidly when the European Currency Unit has until now declined only 11 pct against the yen.? Last week's G-7 meeting in Washington has been widely interpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollar must go lower. So worst of all, what if Volcker is correct? At a loss to give an objective explanation, officials can only offer explanations which tend to be highly subjective. \"I don't know and I don't think anyone knows,\" said Hugh Richardson, acting head of the EC delegation in Tokyo. \"What I do know is that Community exporters are making a hell of an effort in this market. If you make an effort, there is money to be made in Japan,\" he added. But U.S. Officials and businessmen are convinced low U.S. Exports to Japan are Japan's fault. They cite restrictive trade practices, protected Japanese trade sectors, such as agriculture, and non-tariff barriers, such as unreasonable checking and customs procedures for car imports. Publicly, Japanese officials remain conciliatory in the face of what they see as U.S. Aggression. In private, they blame U.S. Industry for being uncompetitive. \"We see it that way, but we don't like to seem arrogant,\" said a senior official, who declined to be named. \"We like to refrain from accusing them of not making enough effort.\" Industrialists such as Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Keidanren business group, and Sony Corp chairman Akio Morita repeatedly accuse foreign firms of not making enough effort to understand Japan's markets, and some foreigners agree. \"The real issue is the inability of major sectors of American and European industry to compete not only internationally but even in their home markets,\" Peter Huggler, President of Interallianz Bank Zurich, told a recent conference in Switzerland.

They said they were looking for an acquisition. It doesn't surprise me that they came up with another one,\" said Allan Kaplan of Merrill Lynch and Co. American Brands failed late last year in its 2.9 billion dlrs bid for Chesebrough-Ponds Inc when Unilever N.V. agreed to buy the company. But since then, Wall Street has been speculating that American Brands would find another candidate to help reduce its earnings exposure to tobacco. \"This is just typical,\" said George Thompson of Prudential-Bache securities. \"There's going to be more to come here. American Brands had to make an acquisition because tobacco is still a significant part of earnings. Their position is a little less favorable than Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds,\" he said. cash flow from its low growth tobacco, but the tobacco business does require great amounts of capital expenditures. It can therefore use its funds to make acquisitions. Analysts said the National Distillers' spirits company, which makes Gilbey's gin and vodka, Old Grandad and Old Crow whiskey, is not quite the type of acquisition they envisioned. \"The distilled spirits business has been in a steady gradual decline for sometime, as has the tobacco business,\" said Thompson.

  "text": "GAF &lt;GAF> SEEN RAISING BORG-WARNER &lt;BOR> BID GAF Corp, set on acquiring Borg-Warner Corp's valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts to be preparing an increased offer for the Chicago-based company. Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for 4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill Lynch Capital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for 89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash and securities for the balance. Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8. \"I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming in with another bid,\" said one analyst, who values the company at 51 or 52 dlrs per share. GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's stock. \"You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to up the price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you have to. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're looking at it - that it's worth more,\" Pershing and Co analyst Richard Henderson said. Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share. GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. Merrill Lynch officials did not return phone calls. Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman sought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plastics business. The rigid plastics are used in such things as telephones, computer terminals, and appliances. \"Where the heck can you buy a world class chemical operation these days,\" said Henderson. \"He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and he does not like to get pushed around,\" said Henderson. GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeover of the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAF did not win the company, it made a substantial gain on its investment in Carbide. Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into its Borg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offer and does not succeed, a higher bid from another company would give GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock. \"It's a win-win situation,\" said one analyst. One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would be forthcoming shortly. \"I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in this book,\" he said. Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts, protective services, which includes Wells Fargo security guards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service. Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who follows GAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, it would realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 per share. \"I think there's a probability he goes up in price,\" said Rose. Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heyman would do. \"Sam's a low-risk, high-return player.\" \"Is he trying to build a major industrial chemical enterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank,\" Rose said. Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would add earnings momentum to GAF. \"I worked out that paying as much as 50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, if they sold off most of the non-chemical facilities,\" said John Henry of E.F. Hutton. Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986 operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billion dlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and net earnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986. \"The Borg chemical business is great,\" said Rose, adding its only U.S. competitors are Monsanto Co &lt;MCT> and Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>.

This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the U.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world.\" But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, which dragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation fears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits. \"If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street ...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide,\" said Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from other London and Tokyo analysts. Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary pressures and import demand in the U.S., They say. Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the equity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson. \"It would be suicidal for any government in the context of what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their interest rates,\" he added. Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime lending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial system. The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock collapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking crisis for example, thus precipitating recession. It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of 1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists said today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in mind. \"The United States has been able to live on borrowed time. If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic growth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides a more realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy,\" said Capel's Dennis. But he added that markets are still very much in danger. \"The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing is disappearing from the equity markets,\" Dennis noted. David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven (G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar, as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies is still on. Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency stability. But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, said Morrison. \"The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived. To stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong,\" he said.  ",

  "text": "LYNG PLEASED EC TO OFFER GATT FARM PROPOSAL U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said he is pleased the European Community plans to offer a global farm reform plan at GATT later this month, although the United States opposes key parts of the proposal. \"We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal. It will help us in getting the negotiations underway,\" Lyng told Reuters in an interview Tuesday. Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourg endorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission. The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguay round agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26. Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the plan seeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposing curbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe. The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of all farm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and has pressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching a global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988. However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said the Reagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is unrealistic. Asked about such criticism, Lyng said \"The alternative to doing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. I think that is the unrealistic position.\" \"I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we are trying to say.\" Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree a freeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations started. \"All that some countries would like to have would be a wheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat. That doesn't do a thing for us,\" Lyng said. The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range of agricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, he said. At the GATT negotiators meeting next week Canada is expected to offer a proposal as well as the EC. The United States will be represented at the meeting by former agriculture undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, recently appointed special U.S. negotiator on agriculture.  ",

  "text": "DUTCH OFFICIAL RATE CUT SEEN STILL LIKELY A cut of about half a percentage point in Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, although economists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves. Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank, encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and wide premiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German, might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first. Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advances rate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped its repurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct. That rate has remained in force, just holding above the five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial bank borrowings. Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West German repo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff, forcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said. In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to three pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered money market rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans rate on lending under its three month credit quota. Since then, however, both the Central Bank and Finance Ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates. In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he would follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the Finance Ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billion guilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pct for an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965. Technically, analysts said, there has to be a difference between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under the credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which add extra liquidity to the money market. Bank economists and dealers said a West German move to further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would result in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate, provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted. The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its parity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673 guilders per 100 marks. Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10 guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a level that would not permit a change in the interest rate differential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealers said. An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and Dutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, he said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates in the longer term. In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil, or even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts point to a falling rate of economic growth. \"It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,\" the ABN economist said. He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in January, could also contribute to some inflation. At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to two pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates, currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in the second half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct. Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying spree on the bond market which would bring yields down, probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below five pct. Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct in the money market.  ",

A three-man Japanese trade team is already in Washington laying the groundwork for talks between Kuroda and Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith aimed at persuading the U.S. Not to impose tariffs on certain Japanese products. But Kuroda said he is taking no new proposals. \"I have nothing in my briefcase except an explanation of the current situation,\" Kuroda told the daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun. Kuroda said the U.S. Decision was based on incorrect data and an exaggerated sense of MITI's power to control market forces. \"The U.S. Has excessive expectations. To stabilise supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time,\" he said. Kuroda also laid part of the blame for low U.S. Chip sales in Japan on a lack of effort by American firms here.

  "text": "SAUDI OIL RESERVES RISE DESPITE HIGHER OUTPUT Proven oil and gas deposits in Saudi Arabia increased in 1986 despite higher oil output, according to the kingdom's main producing company, Aramco. Recoverable oil reserves in Aramco fields rose to 167 billion barrels by the end the year from 166.5 billion in 1985, while gas reserves jumped by 7.7 pct to 135.8 trillion cu ft from 126.1 trillion, the company's annual report said. Aramco, responsible for all Saudi production except about 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, increased production to 4.69 mln barrels per day in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier.  Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, as OPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapture their share of the market. In the process, prices collapsed from about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until the organisation decided to cut production again from last September onwards. Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s. Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightly to 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on the official Saudi Press Agency. The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in the number of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985.  Aramco's only refinery, at Ras Tannurah, processed 142.44 mln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year. The plant was upgraded to a capacity of 530,000 bpd during the year, enabling it to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products, the report said. The country's other five, smaller refineries -- owned by another state-owned oil organisation, Petromin -- produced around 750,000 bpd last year.  Sulphur production rose to 1.23 mln tonnes in 1986 from 998,707 tonnes in 1985. During the year the company began operating a sulphur granule plant with capacity of 4,000 tonnes per day, the report said. Aramco said it awarded 1,303 contracts last year worth 1.4 billion riyals -- about 370 mln dlrs.  ",

  "text": "CENTRAL BANK HEAD SAYS PHILIPPINE GROWTH ON TARGET The Philippines' first quarter growth figures released yesterday indicated the government was likely to achieve its 1987 targets, Central Bank governor Jose Fernandez said in an interview. The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) announced yesterday gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.78 pct and gross national product (GNP) 5.53 pct in the first quarter from a year earlier. \"I don't see anything on the horizon that should cut it (growth) short,\" Fernandez said. NEDA said GNP had grown 3.56 pct and GDP 3.25 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. Last year's GNP growth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct. \"Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources and if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and would not be a stumbling block,\" Fernandez said. \"I think even before the figures came out, simply looking at key indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power, showed that the economy was on a different track from last year,\" he said. Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the first and second quarters because of the dry weather, and it could drop off in the third quarter. He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the manufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in 1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986. \"That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular,\" he said. He said the government had met all monetary targets set for the first quarter in consultation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourth tranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon. The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling 58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988. Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July or August to review performance in the January-June period. He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billion dlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs. Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their net repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years. \"It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA (official development assistance) accounts the commercial banking system will be requested to hold the line,\" he said. It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMF debt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said. The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28 billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March. Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984 to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos in April 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started in October last year, had almost been completed. He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding level touched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well. \"Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool,\" he said. Commenting on the country's foreign debt Fernandez said, \"I think the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap forward as might have been suitable.\" The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach 29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987. NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the first quarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs. Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of between six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that while growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved. Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some economists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to the dollar, ought to be devalued to make the country's exports more competitive. \"By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso has already substantially devalued against all of the country's trading partners,\" he said. On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he was opposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two years after the imposition of the Code. The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, has been delayed by objections from some business groups. \"I think any central bank, certainly this one after the events of the past two or two and a half years, has to be prudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the winds and I'm not about to do that,\" Fernandez said. \"It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of capital and earnings can be free,\" he said. \"We have had one year of reasonably good results. Certainly we continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our external availabilities simply by servicing our debts.\"  ",

  "text": "ASIAN COCOA PRODUCERS EXPAND DESPITE CRITICS Asian cocoa producers are expanding output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss suggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior. \"Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market from our product,\" said a spokesman for Indonesia's directorate general of plantations. \"We're happy about our long-term future.\" Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in Asia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitable for European tastes. They were responding to comments by London traders that large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoa prices. London traders said the Asian cocoa was considered unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a high level of free fatty acids. Ng Siew Kee, the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers' Council, said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and the United States if it did not produce a type suitable for Western Europe. A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said the London market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa with high-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans. \"When the market is declining, buyers seize on anything to talk down prices,\" the spokesman said. He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces. PNG exported 33,000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa year ending September 30, of which nearly 50 pct was exported to West Germany, 16 pct to the U.S. And the rest to the Netherlands and Britain. The Indonesia spokesman, an Agriculture Ministry official who wished not to be identified, said Indonesia had no problem with quality and would continue to expand sales. He described criticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as \"trade politics\" and said Jakarta's traditional links with Dutch buyers meant it did not have any difficulty with exports. Indonesia and Malaysia, Asia's two biggest commodity producers, are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO). Officials have said Malaysian production is expected to total 150,000 to 155,000 tonnes in calendar 1987. This is up from 131,000 tonnes in 1986, partly because of the end of a three-year drought in Sabah, the country's largest cocoa growing area. Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31,600 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. Output is projected to rise to 50,000 tonnes in 1988 from 38,000 tonnes this year as young trees mature. Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers and traders said they could last out low prices longer than West African countries. According to one Kuala Lumpur trader, world prices would have to fall another 1,000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to make cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic. Some traders believe the main quality problem is with harvesting and fermentation techniques. One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtually indistinguishable from West African output if treated in the same way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysian estates.  ",

The measure, however, does not require President Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act as does a related Senate bill. The controversial War Powers Act could require a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf. The Senate voted 67-28 to stop a filibuster and limit debate to 30 hours on a bipartisan measure that requires Reagan to report to Congress on Gulf policy within 60 days and calls for a resolution to be passed in the House and Senate on the situation in the volatile waterway 30 days later. The resolution could be about any Gulf-related issue, including an expression of support or of disapproval for Reagan's policy of protecting 11 Kuwaiti tankers from Iran in the waterway. The Pentagon said the 12th U.S.-protected convoy began moving through the Gulf early Tuesday.  ",

  "text": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTRALIAN MARKETS BOOMING Australian markets are booming as foreign fund managers redirect capital away from the United States and other traditional markets, analysts said. High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of fresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese and U.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said. Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in and have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as they diversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said. A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in the past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the currency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow. Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital are not available, but brokers said they received almost daily inquiries from Japan and the United States. \"These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about and they don't know what to do with it. Some of that is ending up here with the attraction of high interest rates and reasonable currency stability,\" National Australia Bank Ltd economist Brian Hamley said. \"There is a 'flight to quality',\" Hamley said. \"Australia may not be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't too many other countries where you'd want to put your money.\" The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against the volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said. \"We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S. Where some people would be concerned about the value of the U.S. Dollar,\" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose said. \"Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap and the currency looks stable?\" But turning that capital into more permanent productive investment depends on government economic policy, he said. \"It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the direction in the economy,\" Buttrose said, adding that offshore investors would carefully watch the government's promised tough economic statement on May 14. While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding interest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar and hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said. \"It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be delivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, one might see a substantial outflow,\" Buttrose said. Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and stubborn current account deficit, analysts said. \"They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think they would like to leave the money here,\" Buttrose said. Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations. Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency policy when he said authorities could not take their \"eyes off the yen\" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors. Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar within the range of 100 to 103 yen. Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks. Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming Australian share market. It has followed Wall Street and other markets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into equities, particularly in the gold sector. The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3 today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the same period. The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese companies that have invested heavily in the United States in recent years turning their attention to undervalued real estate, particularly in the tourism field. Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-star Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs as indicative of the type of property being sought. \"They think they find good value real estate here which, with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of investment Australia needs,\" Buttrose added.

The move drove short-term interest rates sharply higher, with overnight and tomorrow-next funds more than doubling from last Wednesday and hitting 20 pct. There were few offers in a tight market and traders scrambled for any available funds. One-month to one-year deposits were indicated one point higher at eight, seven pct but there was little activity at the longer end of the market. Bankers see the suspension of central bank aid as a deliberate move to drive up Kuwaiti dinar interest rates and stem a flow of funds out of the country, where market nervousness is increasing over the growing tension in the Gulf. The central bank's move has been combined with a steady cut in the dinar exchange rate. Today's rate was reduced to 0.27939/73 to the dollar from 0.27758/92 on Wednesday before the four day bank holiday that celebrated the end of the fasting month of Ramadan.  ",

Earlier today, closely held Computerland, the largest PC retailing chain in the country, said it agreed to be bought by an investor group led by E.M. Warburg Pincus and Co, New York. Neither Computerland, which is 96 pct owned by its founder, William H. Millard, nor E.M. Warburg, a money management and venture capital firm, would disclose the value of the transaction. Analysts estimated that Computerland, whose 800 stores generated 1.4 billion dlrs in sales last year, would fetch  150 mln dlrs to 250 mln dlrs. Computerland franchise owners pay royalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company. Officials for E.M. Warburg referred all questions to Computerland. Computerland officials could not immediately be reached for comment. E.M. Warburg currently manages 1.5 billion dlrs in venture capital funds, and its past investments have included Mattel Inc &lt;MAT> and the Ingersoll newspaper chain. It is also a money manager, with 3.5 billion dlrs under management. Although the PC retailers are benefitting from the strong upturn in PC sales, analysts said Computerland must make key changes if it is to fend off advances from rivals like Businessland Inc &lt;BUSL.O> and Tandy Corp's &lt;TAN> Radio Shack stores. \"The name of the game now is outbound sales forces, customer service and customer support,\" said Levy of International Data.  Relations between Computerland and its franchise owners have mellowed recently after Millard was forced to give up managment control of the company in 1985. Ed Faber, who took over as chairman and chief executive officer, revamped the company's royalty plan, which help quell much of the franchisee dissent.  ",

Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S. Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to protect local farmers. Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said. End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports. Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year beef accord next March 31. Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier. U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said. An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S. Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing some one billion dlrs in new business. The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices, purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts, prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans. To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove residual import restrictions on agricultural products. But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the industrial sector. \"Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these issues should not be discussed on the same table,\" the official said.

Several hours before a regularly scheduled board of directors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requested consent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs per share. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in November not to buy stock for 10 years without permission. \"I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and more interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands to make a ton of money,\" said Andrew Shore, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. \"In play\" is a term used on Wall Street to describe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling takeover target. Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon gets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through November of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per share. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain of three yesterday. The agreement would be calculated on the basis of Perelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for a split. For example, a deal between Gillette and some other company at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262 mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmen returned telephone calls seeking comment. \"Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if someone else takes over Gillette,\" said Analyst Deepak Raj of Merrill Lynch and Co. \"I'm not saying that is going to happen but Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45 dlrs per share.\" Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasons why Perelman may not be really interested in acquiring Gillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlon private after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two years ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon's operations. \"He's trying to overhaul and improve the image of the dearptment store business.\" Another reason is that Revlon has recently made two other acquisitions. Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised if some company such as Unilever plc &lt;UN.AS> or Procter and Gamble Co &lt;PG> decided to take a look at Gillette. Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for Gillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc &lt;HAN>, RJR Nabisco Inc &lt;RJR>, American Brands Inc &lt;AMB> and Ralston Purina Co &lt;RAL>. \"Perelman is trying to put the company in play,\" said a Wall Street arbitrageur. \"He gets to share in the upside if the company is sold.\" Another arbitrageur said he expects Gillette to resist Perelman's overture. \"I can't see the board consenting, what has changed between November and now,\" he said.  Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on. \"Perelman never does anything without a fair amount of calculation,\" he said. But he added, \"The Gillette board has to be careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued by shareholders.\" Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT, three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time. According to a copy of Perelman's letter released by Gillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive merger agreement without any financing condition. He said Citibank N.A. is his lead lender and First Boston Inc is his financial adviser.  ",

Initially, the rights are not exerciseable, rights certificates are not distributed, and the rights automatically trade with Northeast's shares, the company said. However, 20 days following the acquisition of 20 pct or more of Northeast's common shares shares or 20 days following the commencement of a tender offer for 30 pct or more of Northeast's shares, the rights will become exerciseable and separate rights certificates will be distributed, the company said. The rights will entitle holders of Northeast's common shares to purchase additional shares at an exercise price of 60 dlrs a share, the company said. The company said that in the event of certain triggering events described in the rights plan, holders of the rights, other than an acquiring person, will be entitled to acquire Northeast's common shares having a market value of twice the then-current exercise price of the rights. Also, in the event Northeast enters into certain business combination transactions, holders of the rights will be provided a right to acquire equity securities of the acquiring entity having a market value of twice the then-current exercise price of the rights, the company said.

  "text": "GERMAN EXPERTS SAY NO FURTHER ECONOMIC STIMULUS The West German government's independent council of economic experts believes a further stimulation of the economy is inappropriate, government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said. A statement released by Ost after a meeting of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and senior government officials with the council said the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-1/2 to two pct was achievable. It added the council believed \"an intensification of the already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial policy is not called for.\" Ost's statement said experts believed further pressure on West Germany to adapt to external economic factors would not increase. The government regularly uses the term \"changed external economic factors\" when referring to the fall of the dollar, which has severely damaged West German exports. Bonn officials have said they expect exports to pick up during the year, but could still fall below the 1986 level. Along with other leading industrial countries, West Germany agreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris in February aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar. The stance taken by the experts backs up the official position of the West German government ahead of next week's seven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to be pressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy. West German government officials have stressed Bonn is not in a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due next year and 1990 are already stretching the budget. The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in official interest rates although it sees market rates continuing low. The experts' prediction for economic growth this year of between 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a forecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast. Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987 predictions in light of the downturn in exports. The government itself has said it expects growth of just under two pct, compared with a 2.4 pct expansion in 1986.  ",

  "text": "NEW ZEALAND BUDGET FORECAST SEEN AS POSITIVE Analysts said they were surprised at the government's announcement of a forecast budget surplus for fiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policy statements and positive for the economy. Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplus for the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrs against a 1.95 billion deficit last year. Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surplus was even more positive than the most bullish analysts' forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets. Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reuters before the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a 2.3 billion dlr deficit. But none predicted a surplus. The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and the foreign exchange markets, one analyst said. Paradoxically, the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despite lower interest rates, as overseas investors became more confident about investing in New Zealand, he said. However, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, saying the local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will move lower. The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in after hours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budget release. Analysts said the budget was also positive for the share market, despite an increase in the contribution of company taxation to revenue figures. One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus announcement could push the share market up by 50 points tomorrow. The Budget statement was broadly as expected, with a continuation of existing policies, and the absence of traditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positively by overseas investors, another said. But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-tax avoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share market, particularly multi-national companies. The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements, through bond tenders, as a result of the surplus. The requirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln N.Z. Dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion. Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable and there appeared to be no holding back on expenditure, another economist said. He added that the document seemed entirely credible. \"Altogether it looks good for Labour's election prospects,\" he said. An election is due before the end of September.  ",

Commenting on press reports about the 50 mln dlr price tag, Black said, \"That would not be wildly inaccurate,\" although he declined to disclose the actual cost. Montreal-based Unimedia is Quebec's third largest newspaper group, with three French language daily newspapers in Quebec City, Ottawa and Chicoutimi, Quebec and four printing plants in Ontario and Quebec. Black added that Hollinger would also continue seeking acquisitions of daily newspapers with circulation under 25,000 readers. He said Hollinger was currently talking to about 10 such newspapers in the U.S. where the company currently owns 23 dailies. \"There is really no end to the ones that are available,\" he told reporters, although he added that most remaining acquisition opportunities are in the U.S. He said that Hollinger's 58 pct-owned Daily Telegraph PLC, of London, should become profitable in this year's fourth quarter.  For full-year 1987, the Daily Telegraph could break even or better, said Black, citing major reductions in labor costs and improved technology at the Telegraph, Britain's largest circulation quality daily. The Telegraph lost 13.2 mln Canadian dlrs last year. Daily Telegraph chief executive Andrew Knight told reporters after the meeting that the Telegraph's daily circulation had risen by 25,000 since September to about 1,150,000 on weekdays, despite added competition from the new Independent daily newspaper.  Knight said The Independent was not affecting the Telegraph's growth, but was making inroads into the circulation of other London quality dailies such as The Times and The Guardian. Hollinger chairman Black predicted Hollinger would post 1987 net income of about 55 mln dlrs, or one dlr a share, including extraordinary gains from previous sales of discontinued operations. Hollinger lost 87 mln dlrs or 6.54 dlrs a share last year on fewer average shares and after an extraordinary loss of 52 mln dlrs.  Black told shareholders that first quarter operating earnings on continuing operations amounted to 499,000 dlrs against a year-ago loss of 165,000 dlrs. Revenues on continuing operations rose to 102.1 mln dlrs from 1.5 mln dlrs last year, which did not include Daily Telegraph revenues, he added. Consolidated first quarter figures were not disclosed. He said the Daily Telegraph's first quarter operating loss was sharply reduced from last year.  ",

Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April 23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman added. \"It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the crop is off to a very good start,\" he said. Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600 hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar, substantially more than the country's combined \"A\" and \"B\" quota of 872,000 tonnes. This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000 hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000 tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota \"C\" sugar produced. Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.  ",

Recently, the Columbia Gas System Inc pipeline subsidiary said, FERC denied on procedural grounds and without prejudice a proposal to include these costs in the company's most recent purchased gas adjustment -- or PGA -- filing. Noting it has has asked for a rehearing on the denial ruling, Columbia Gas said it would withdraw its alternative filing if the commission grantes its request for a rehearing to include the contract renegotiation costs in its PGA or consolidates this issue in the pipeline's general rate filing and permit recovery, subject to refund, effective April one. The company said the alternative filing seeks to recover about 79 mln dlrs a year through the pipeline's non-gas sales commodity rates. This annual amortization amount is based on recovery of about 653 mln drls over an 8-1/4 year period, beginning April 1, 1987. Columbia Gas said the filing would increase the pipeline commodity rates by 15.74 cts per mln Btu to 2.95 dlrs per mln. The company said it orginially sought to include these costs in its PGA since the payments to products resulted in almost five billion dlrs in prospective price relief and were not related to take-or-pay buyout costs. It explained this interpretation was based on FERC's April 10, 1985, Statement of Policy which said that only take-or-pay buyout costs must be recovered through a general rate filing under the Natural Gas Act. As a result of renegotiating contracts for high-cost gas, Columbia Gas said, it has been able to reduce the average price paid for gas purchased from Southwest producers to 1.96 dlrs per mln Btu in December 1986 from 3.64 dlrs per mln in April 1985. The pipeline said Southwestern producers account for 46 pct of its total available gas supply this year.  ",

  "text": "POEHL LOOKS SET FOR EIGHT MORE YEARS AT BUNDESBANK For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl is the scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who has played a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny for the last seven years, and for Germans he is the guardian of the mark. President of the powerful and independent West German central bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have his contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the end of this year, government officials say. (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA) But no official announcement has yet been made, raising eyebrows in West Germany's business community. The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top ministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now in opposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank. There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own Christian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has worked closely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982. Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul Volcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up. Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook Poehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor Willy Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was Finance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as Chancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980. In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the dollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of the Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent inflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts of galloping inflation this century. But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and inflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate. \"I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the Bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark would endanger the economy in West Germany,\" he told business journalists in Frankfurt recently. Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that Poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy. \"Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not focus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external economy,\" she said. An economist at a German bank, who declined to be identified, said \"If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so rigidly oriented towards money supply.\" One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to persuade the United States to stop \"talking down\" the dollar. For Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise currencies. The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency dealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact. \"This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they don't know - what the central banks can do,\" Poehl says of intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates round, making a speculator's position worthless. Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career. A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker. He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and play golf. Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced. \"But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount if you strike at the right moment,\" he said. Bundesbank dealers are very professional and skilled. \"They've burnt the fingers of many people,\" he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes, the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit.

  "text": "TALKING POINT/STEEL COMPANIES Steel stocks, which have had a healthy runup recently, still present some short term investment opportunities, according to some steel analysts. But others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firm prices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will end soon. They recommend taking profits. \"It's that time of year. This is strictly seasonal,\" said Charles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. \"Orders will be strong for about two months, and there are signs that some (order rates) are starting to dive already.\" But Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Clarence Morrison sees some short-term potential in the group, which includes USX Corp &lt;X>, Bethlehem Steel Corp &lt;BS>, Armco Inc &lt;AS> and Inland Steel Industries Inc &lt;IAD>. \"There is still some attractiveness to steels over the short- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates and rising prices,\" Morrison said. He only recommends one stock, however, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations to make them more efficient. Despite his bearishness, Merrill's Bradford continues to recommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround. Armco's steelmaking operations are profitable, the balance sheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment business has been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradford noted. \"It's not a high-quality investment situation yet but they've come a long way,\" he said. \"We think the stock will do moderately better than the market,\" he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today, could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said. Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987, before special gains from recouped investment tax credits, against losses last year. Armco's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, he said. Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. \"We had a buy on it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else have it,\" he said. The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a share in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, and from two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. \"But a lot depends on oil prices,\" he added. About 60 pct of USX's sales come from oil and natural gas. Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum of Salomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. \"The company's done a lot (of restructuring), more than the market's given them credit for,\" she said. She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX was trading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts a share this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in 1986. Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, has been recommending the stocks since last November. Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the group although he said the earnings outlook is improved through the third quarter. But he sees potential trouble beyond then. \"I think (steel) prices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,\" he said. Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonal dropoff later in the year. \"But there are more positives than negatives,\" she said, citing reduced capacity in the domestic industry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which should cause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.

U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said the U.S. sought no further Gulf hostitilies but was ready to deal with any Iranian response to Monday's attack on an Iranian oil rig. Several hours later, the Pentagon announced that U.S. warships had begun escorting two U.S. flag Kuwaiti tankers -- the 80,000 ton product carrier Ocean City and 46,000 ton liquified petroleum tanker Gas King -- southward from Kuwait. The Defense Department said the 12th such convoy of U.S. flagged Kuwaiti tankers through the Gulf began at 0230 EDT under the escort by the U.S. guided missile frigate Ford. It did not say what oth U.S. warships were in the area. \"It (the convoy) is now progressing uneventfully in the central Gulf,\" the Pentagon statement said.

Finance Minister Cleopa Msuya said the government expected to spend 77.33 billion shillings in the financial year 1987/8, 39 pct more than this year's estimate. Revenue would provide 48.84 billion shillings, leaving a deficit of 28.49 billion to be financed through domestic and foreign loans. This year's budget initially projected a deficit of only 3.35 billion shillings but in mid-year the government had to impose new taxes to keep the deficit roughly on target. No figure for the final deficit was avaialble. The budget gave civil servants a 20 pct pay rise with effect from July 1, to compensate for inflation of more than 30 pct. Msuya said regular petrol would go up 52 pct, with similar increases in the cost of premium and kerosene. Diesel would rise by 75 pct. The higher levies affect official transactions such as road tolls, vehicle transfers and various licence fees, he added.  ",

The holders, none of whom was willing to be identified, said although Harcourt has urged that they convert their shares to common stock by the June eight record date for a special dividend, they were unable to determine if it might be better for them to continue holding the debentures.  \"There are rumors that various houses will bring litigation if we don't get answers,\" said a Wall Street source. Officials of Harcourt declined to comment, citing a suit brought by British publisher Robert Maxwell whose has been trying to acquire Harcourt. Executives of First Boston Inc, Harcourt's financial adviser, did not return a telephone call seeking comment. When it announced its recapitalization May 26 Harcourt advised holders of the 6-3/8 pct convertible subordinated debentures due 2011 to convert into common by the June eight record date for the company's special dividend. Harcourt's special dividend pays 40 dlrs per share in cash plus a security worth 10 dlrs. Holders would also retain stock in the recapitalized firm. The debentures had been convertible at 34 dlrs per share. Harcourt's May 26 announcement said the conversion price would be adjusted according to the indenture covering the securities. Arbitrageurs said the conversion formula yielded a \"negative number\" and thus they needed further information from the company.  ",

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Zinn said the demand for the shareholder list was made on June 26 because he may desire to communicate with other Crazy Eddie shareholders \"regarding the affairs\" of the company. Zinn and his firm, which disclosed they hold a 5.1 pct stake in Crazy Eddie common stock, said they may acquire more shares through a negotiated merger or tender offer. Entertainment Marketing was informed on June 25 by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., acting on behalf of Crazy Eddie, that it would be provided with \"certain information\" about Crazy Eddie, it told the SEC. Entertainment Marketing, a Houston-based firm involved in electronics wholesaling and televised home shopping sales, proposed an eight dlr a share merger acquisition of Crazy Eddie on May 29, and modified the proposal on June 9 to include the possible participation of Crazy Eddie management. Entertainment Marketing told the SEC it expects to meet with Crazy Eddie representatives in the near future. Entertainment Marketing also disclosed that it retained Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc as its financial advisor and investment banker. In light of a June 17 announcement from Crazy Eddie that Chemical Bank would no longer fund a 52 mln dlr credit facility with the company, plus further declines in the price of its stock, Entertainment Marketing and Zinn said they are \"continuing to evaluate their alternatives with respect to their investment\" in Crazy Eddie stock. Depending on its evaluation of the company, including actions by Crazy Eddie's board and any possible third party bids for the company, Entertainment Marketing and its president said they may hold their present stake in the company, sell some of their shares, or purchase more shares on the open market, through private purchases or in connection with a merger or tender offer. According to the SEC filing, Entertainment Marketing and Zinn bought their current holdings of 1,560,000 Crazy Eddie common shares between May 20 and June 17 at 7.42 dlrs to 7.93 dlrs a share, or a total of about 11.9 mln dlrs.

Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer substantial payments to creditors will expire. Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan. Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as public noteholders in March after several months of delicate negotiations. TransCanada's proposal \"amounts to a quasi debt restructuring,\" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd said from Toronto. Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt. \"The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,\" said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in Calgary. TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed refinancing packages, Gobert said. The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders to agree to a restructuring, he added. \"I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain any and all offers (for Dome),\" Gobert said. Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other possible buyers from making an offer. \"By drawing attention to us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little reluctant to come forward,\" he said. Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a confidential agreement between the two companies, he said. Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including TransCanada's. Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings. However, he said not enough financial details are known about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of TransCanada's proposed offer.  ",

Khalaf al-Oteiba, Marketing Director at the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), told the company's Petroleum Community magazine ADNOC was also keen to keep good customer relations. \"The company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its customers in accordance with market conditions...And take necessary steps to guarantee marketing its production,\" he said. \"The present oil marketing policy of ADNOC is based on adherence to OPEC decisions of December 1986 to control production and establish a new pricing system in an attempt to stabilize the market,\" he added. OPEC agreed last December to limit production to 15.8 mln bpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. Oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future depended on how much discipline OPEC showed. Oteiba said last year, when world oil prices dropped, was ADNOC's most difficult ever but \"a practical and flexible pricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market environment.\" He said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average 609,000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported. Refined product sales totalled eight mln metric tonnes, of which 67 pct was exported. In 1985, ADNOC marketed a total of 476,000 bpd of crude oil and 7.2 mln tonnes of refined products.  ",

  "text": "INDONESIAN COMMODITY EXCHANGE MAY EXPAND The Indonesian Commodity Exchange is likely to start trading in at least one new commodity, and possibly two, during calendar 1987, exchange chairman Paian Nainggolan said. He told Reuters in a telephone interview that trading in palm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered. Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oil may also be introduced. But he said the question was still being considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and no decision on when to go ahead had been made. The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber physicals on an open outcry system four days a week. \"Several factors make us move cautiously,\" Nainggolan said. \"We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a mistake and undermine confidence in the exchange.\" Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee added in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up to five months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five are traded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward, exchange officials said. The trade ministry and exchange board are considering the introduction of futures trading later for rubber, but one official said a feasibility study was needed first. No decisions are likely until after Indonesia's elections on April 23, traders said. Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as the world's second largest producer of natural rubber, should expand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of the exchange would help this. Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boost overseas interest by building up contacts with end-users. He said teams had already been to South Korea and Taiwan to encourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation would also visit Europe, Mexico and some Latin American states to encourage participation. Officials say the infant exchange has made a good start although trading in coffee has been disappointing. Transactions in rubber between the start of trading in April 1985 and December 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9 mln dlrs FOB, plus 184.3 mln rupiah for rubber delivered locally, the latest exchange report said. Trading in coffee in calendar 1986 amounted to only 1,905 tonnes in 381 lots, valued at 6.87 billion rupiah. Total membership of the exchange is now nine brokers and 44 traders.  ",
