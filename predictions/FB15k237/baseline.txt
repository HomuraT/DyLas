At the peak of it all, the home video industry was caught up in a series of videotape format wars. Two of the formats, VHS and Betamax, received the most media exposure.

Within the Penalty Area goalkeepers are able to use their hands, making them the only players on the field able to handle the ball. Goalkeepers perform goal kicks, and also give commands to their defence during corner kicks, direct and indirect free kicks, and marking. Goalkeepers play an important role in directing on field strategy as they have an unrestricted view of the entire pitch giving them a unique perspective on play development.\\\\nGoalkeepers are required to remain on the pitch at all times though that does not mean they have to be between the sticks all the time.

It is the most specialised position in the sport. The goalkeeper's primary role is to prevent the opposing team from successfully moving the ball over the defended goal-line. This is accomplished by the goalkeeper moving into the path of the ball and either catching it or directing it away from the vicinity of the goal line. Within the Penalty Area goalkeepers are able to use their hands, making them the only players on the field able to handle the ball. Goalkeepers perform goal kicks, and also give commands to their defence during corner kicks, direct and indirect free kicks, and marking. Goalkeepers play an important role in directing on field strategy as they have an unrestricted view of the entire pitch giving them a unique perspective on play development.\\\\nGoalkeepers are required to remain on the pitch at all times though that does not mean they have to be between the sticks all the time.

The sound is projected either acoustically or through electrical and electronic means. It is traditionally constructed from wood and strung with animal gut or metal strings. Some variations are made partly or entirely of carbon fiber or other unusual materials such as aluminum (aluminum acoustic guitars). There are many types of guitars, each with its own unique characteristics, advantages, and drawbacks. The main components include the body, the neck, the fingerboard, the headstock, and the strings.\\\\nGuitars are recognized as one of the primary instruments in blues, country, flamenco, rock music, and many forms of pop. Many styles of music have been developed with guitars including jazz with its smooth sounds and deep tones, heavy metal with its aggressive riffs, punk with its fast tempos and simple chord progressions, classical guitar with its fingerpicking technique, and many styles of folk. The instrument's versatility has led to it being used in almost every style of music.\\\\nGuitars also appear in ensembles ranging from small sets (e.g., jazz quartets or the rhythm section of a rock band) to large orchestras. A typical performance involves one or more vocalists and/or instrumentalists who sing or play while accompanying themselves with the guitar.

The sound is projected either acoustically or through electrical and electronic means. It is traditionally constructed from wood and strung with animal gut or metal strings. Some variations are made partly or entirely of carbon fiber or other unusual materials such as aluminum (aluminum acoustic guitars). There are many types of guitars, each with its own unique characteristics, advantages, and drawbacks. The main components include the body, the neck, the fingerboard, the headstock, and the strings.\\\\nGuitars are recognized as one of the primary instruments in blues, country, flamenco, rock music, and many forms of pop. Many styles of music have been developed with guitars including jazz with its smooth sounds and deep tones, heavy metal with its aggressive riffs, punk with its fast tempos and simple chord progressions, classical guitar with its fingerpicking technique, and many styles of folk. The instrument's versatility has led to it being used in almost every style of music.\\\\nGuitars also appear in ensembles ranging from small sets (e.g., jazz quartets or the rhythm section of a rock band) to large orchestras. A typical performance involves one or more vocalists and/or instrumentalists who sing or play while accompanying themselves with the guitar.

Such discs are known as DVD-ROM, because data can only be read and not written or erased. Blank recordable DVD discs can be recorded once using a DVD recorder and then function as a DVD-ROM. Rewritable DVDs can be recorded and erased multiple times.\\\\nDVDs are used in DVD-Video consumer digital video format and in DVD-Audio consumer digital audio format, as well as for authoring DVD discs written in a special AVCHD format to hold high definition material. DVDs containing other types of information may be referred to as DVD data discs.\\\"@en\"}</Object>\n<Object>{\"name\": \"Blu-ray_disc\", \"description\": \"\\\"Blu-ray Disc is a digital optical disc data storage format designed to supersede the DVD format. The plastic disc is 120 mm in diameter and 1.2 mm thick, the same size as DVDs and CDs. Conventional Blu-ray Discs contain 25 GB per layer, with dual layer discs being the industry standard for feature-length video discs. Triple layer discs and quadruple layers are available for BD-XL re-writer drives. The name Blu-ray Disc refers to the blue laser used to read the disc, which allows information to be stored at a greater density than is possible with the longer-wavelength red laser used for DVDs. The major application of Blu-ray Discs is as a medium for video material such as feature films. Besides the hardware specifications, Blu-ray Disc is associated with a set of multimedia formats. Generally, these formats allow for the video and audio to be stored with greater definition than on DVD.\\\\nThe format was developed by the Blu-ray Disc Association, a group representing makers of consumer electronics, computer hardware, and motion pictures. Sony unveiled the first Blu-ray Disc prototypes in October 2000, and the first prototype player was released in April 2003 in Japan. Afterwards, it continued to be developed until its official release in June 2006. As of June 2008, more than 2,500 Blu-ray Disc titles were available in Australia and the United Kingdom, with 3,500 in the United States and Canada. In Japan, as of July 2010, more than 3,300 titles have been released.\\\"@en\"}</Object>\n<Object>{\"name\": \"VHS\", \"description\": \"\\\"VHS is a home video format created by JVC which became one of the most popular formats for home video watching in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Displaced by the DVD format in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the use of the VHS format has now declined significantly. However, VHS recorders are still used to a lesser extent for recording video content from various sources, such as TV or other video devices.

With a career that spanned six decades, he is known for his explorations of the human condition through issues such as mortality, faith, betrayal, and mental illness as well as through psychological insights into the human psyche. He directed over sixty films and plays. Bergman was born in Uppsala, Sweden during the summer of 1918. He grew up with his mother, Karin, a nurse, and his father, Erik Bergman, a Lutheran minister and later chaplain to the King of Sweden. The family moved to Stockholm when Erik became pastor with the Royal Dramatic Theatre parish. Ingmar's early life was marked by a deep interest in theatre and film attending performances at the Royal Dramatic Theatre. He began writing stories and plays while still at school, including some that would later be adapted into films. At 19 he enrolled in Stockholm University College to study art and literature but dropped out after one year. Bergman suffered from depression and anxiety throughout his life which was reflected in his work. In the early 1950s he wrote and directed a trilogy of films that dealt with themes of love, death, and spiritual crisis: Through a Glass Darkly, Winter Light, and The Silence. He produced and directed many acclaimed films usually written by himself including Smiles of a Summer Night, The Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, Persona, Cries and Whispers, Autumn Sonata, and Fanny and Alexander as well as many stage productions. Bergman was married five times and had nine children, one of whom predeceased him. He died peacefully from natural causes in his sleep at the age of 89 on a remote island off the coast of Sweden where he lived much of his later life.

It is the most specialised position in the sport. The goalkeeper's primary role is to prevent the opposing team from successfully moving the ball over the defended goal-line. This is accomplished by the goalkeeper moving into the path of the ball and either catching it or directing it away from the vicinity of the goal line. Within the Penalty Area goalkeepers are able to use their hands, making them the only players on the field able to handle the ball. Goalkeepers perform goal kicks, and also give commands to their defence during corner kicks, direct and indirect free kicks, and marking. Goalkeepers play an important role in directing on field strategy as they have an unrestricted view of the entire pitch giving them a unique perspective on play development.\\\\nGoalkeepers are required to remain on the pitch at all times though that does not mean they have to be between the sticks all the time. For example goalkeepers may have to take a penalty kick during a penalty shoot-out or even go for a corner late in the game though it is rare, as it leaves the goal unguarded. If a goalkeeper is hurt or sent off a substitute goalkeeper can take his place, if there isn't a substitute, then an outfielder must do so. In the event of a sending off teams often substitute an outfield player so that a specialist player can come in to the team to effectively replace the sent-off goalkeeper. If a team does not have a substitute goalkeeper, or they have already used all of their alloted substitutes for the match, an outfield player has to take his place and wear the goalkeeper kit. Because goalkeeper is the most important job in football as well as being the most difficult position to master, most teams have specialist players that only ever play in goal. Goalkeepers appear to have longer playing careers than outfield players, many not retiring until their late thirties or early forties, an example of this beingPeter Shilton who played for 31 years between 1966 and 1997, retiring at the age of 47. The main squad number for a goalkeeper is no.1 but today though this is still common some goalkeepers now wear other squad numbers when in goal. For example: Despite being no.1 at Liverpool, Pepe Reina has worn the no.25 jersey through all his Liverpool career.

The state of Alaska is the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.79 million square miles in total and with around 317 million people, the United States is the fourth-largest country by total area and third largest by population. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.\\\\nPaleo-indians migrated from Asia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence.

The band consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt, drummer Tr\\u00e9 Cool and guitarist and backing vocalist Jason White, who became a full member after playing in the band as a session and touring guitarist for 13 years. Cool replaced former drummer John Kiffmeyer in 1990, prior to the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk.\\\\nGreen Day was originally part of the punk scene at the DIY 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were from the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, its major label debut Dookie released through Reprise Records became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands Sublime, Bad Religion, The Offspring and Rancid, with popularizing and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States.\\\\nGreen Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac, Nimrod, and Warning did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, though they were still successful, with Insomniac and Nimrod reaching double platinum and Warning reaching gold status. The band's rock opera, American Idiot, reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the United States. The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009 which achieved the band's best chart performance to date. In 2012, 21st Century Breakdown was followed up by a trilogy of albums called \\u00a1Uno!, \\u00a1Dos!, and \\u00a1Tr\\u00e9! released on September, November and December 2012 respectively.\\\"@en</Object><Object>{\"name\": \"Billie_Joe_Armstrong\", \"description\": \"\\\"Billie Joe Armstrong is an American musician, singer, songwriter and occasional actor.
