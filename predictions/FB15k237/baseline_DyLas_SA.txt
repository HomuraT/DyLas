Without more specific information about the adaptation, this seems plausible.\n\n2. **Dilys Award**: The Dilys Award is indeed relevant as it is awarded for mystery titles and Michael Connelly writes crime fiction, which includes mysteries. This nomination aligns with his genre.\n\n3. **Pulitzer Prize for Fiction**: While Michael Connelly's works are highly acclaimed within the crime fiction genre, the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction tends to recognize a broader range of literary fiction. However, it's not impossible that one of his novels could be considered, especially if it transcends the typical boundaries of its genre.\n\n4. **Dilys Award (Second Mention)**: The repetition here seems unnecessary unless it indicates multiple nominations or wins across different years for Michael Connelly's works. If this is the case, then it would be accurate to list it as such, but typically, a list of awards might only include each award once.\n\nGiven these considerations and without further information to contradict these assessments, the predicted objects appear to be correct in their essence, though the duplication of the Dilys Award seems unnecessary unless specifying different years or works."], "labels": ["/m/02r6nbc", "/m/04jhhng"]}

DVDs offer higher storage capacity than compact discs while having the same dimensions. Prerecorded DVDs are mass-produced using molding machines that physically stamp data onto the DVD. Such discs are known as DVD-Video if they contain the MPEG-2 codec or DVD-Audio if they contain uncompressed audio content. See the list of DVD manufacturers for some of these; Blank recordable DVD discs can be recorded using a DVD recorder. DVD recorders are standalone devices resembling VCRs, but capable of reading and recording, unlike VCRs, which do not have this capability. There are also DVD drives for computers, along with software for copying the contents to CDs if desired. DVD drives may be purchased separately for computers running Windows and other operating systems; they can also be obtained with a computer that has one or more built-in optical drives such as iMacs from late 1999 through 2009. They did not come with Mac Pro, but some Power Macs came with a \\\"SuperDrive\\\" capable of reading DVDs along with CDs so long as an external monitor is connected while running the Classic Environment.
